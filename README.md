# cookiecutter-flask

This is a fairly opinionated [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) skeleton for
[Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter).

Heavily influenced by

  * [flask-skeleton](https://github.com/ryankanno/flask-skeleton)
  * [cookiecutter-py](https://github.com/ryankanno/cookiecutter-py)

## What you'll get (eventually)

  * pyenv virtualenv created
  * teamocil yml file
  * konch configuration
  * bootstrap 3
  * user integration

## Todo

  * Add version into __init__.py
